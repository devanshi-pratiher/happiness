# Analysis of the Factors Affecting World Happiness
Analyzing World Happiness Reports to answer important questions using R and Applied Statistics

By: Devanshi Pratiher


## Background
Happiness is one of the most driving and important reasons to be alive. Happiness is something everyone desires and strives for. However it is important to note that many factors affect happiness.  

The concept of the World Happiness Report was founded in the United Nations. The UN General Assembly adopted a resolution where country members were assembled and invited them to measure the happiness of their people. This data would then be used to create new policies that would help increase peopleâ€™s happiness in their states. 

In this report, I will use the World Happiness Reports from different years to ask important questions and analyze results that would hopefully answer these questions.
